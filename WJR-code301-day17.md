### Day 17 -- Nov 14 ###

Today we came very close to finishing the base functionality of the site.  We were able to hit the API and get results back, then load them in the DB.

I was pleased to see my grade on the exam go up when accounting for the 3 questions with multiple right answers.  I heard other students complaining after spending 4 whole hours on the exam and getting some trick questions wrong.  I spent 15-16 hours on it between Friday night, most of Saturday, and the final five questions taking up Sunday.  I was pretty disappointed with the initial score, and on Sunday I poured lots and lots of time into the final five questions, only to get most of the wrong.  I suspect they were the questions that were adjusted.
