# WJR Code 201 - Day 14

Today I learned...

about more advanced JavaScript.  We have been learning some very fundamental, very long-form ways of doing things, but now we have a glimpse into how some of these functional tasks could be accomplished in far fewer characters.  

I'm a little disappointed that Ruby is a framework in decline, but the CF team seems very hot on Python, more JavaScript (with an emphasis on Angular) and perhaps even Swift.  I look forward to having enough experience in programming that I can exhibit a preference for framework when starting a new project.
