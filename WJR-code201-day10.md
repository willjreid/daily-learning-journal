# WJR Code 201 - Day 10

Today I learned...

A little more about the dynamic table calculation process and the form link input process.  I spotted some errors in my own code this morning going over Jake's code.  It was gratifying to see that the hive mind, even as we got stuck a few times, was able to get his table functionality to work with only 90 minutes of effort.  

We looked briefly at debugging, with an emphasis on using debugger; to pause the code functionality (as long as you have a console window open) so you can use the console window to check your variables to see what value has been assigned to them.  

The afternoon was spent in a rapid design and implementation project.  The final hour before the due date, as expected, was the most productive hour of the day.
