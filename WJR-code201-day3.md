Today I learned...

About the importance of not modifying the user's inputs before capturing them.

We discussed truth vs truthyness.  You don't need absolutely true or absolutely false values in your if statements, you just need truthy or fasley statements.

Loops:
A function that runs repeatedly as long as the inputs allow.
Use break to break out of a loop that is in danger of running infinitely. Use continue to keep running the loop and not leave to execute a next-loop feature, such as running a command.log.

Boxes:
Every element in your html page is a box. Your list is a box.  Block items have a width of the entire container they live in.  Use CSS rules to determine what you do with overflowing content -- by default yo udon nothing with it.  Try overflow-y: scroll; or overflow: hidden;
Margin is the space between my box and other elements on the page. try Margin-bottom: 80px; to add more space below my box. Padding is the space between my box edge and the content i am displaying in it.
