# WJR Code 201 - Day 19

Today I learned...

a little more about liquid layout.  It seems that our page worked perfectly on all three of our machines, but some of the sizing and formatting things were thrown off when we moved to the overhead display. It seems to have a different aspect ratio and zoom default, so we had to juggle some things around.  We also made our videos auto-play but some of the copywrited videos do not allow autoplay.  And we uncovered a logic issue with how we were counting user preference because we had added two class types onto our clickable responses.  When we updated the class === logic to match the right set of classes exactly the counting worked again.  Classes are delicate things.
