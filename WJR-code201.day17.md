# WJR Code 201 - Day 17

more about animation.  Most of the animation features you'd like to demonstrate through CSS are out there and just need some prior tweaking.

My conversation with Shayne at the end of the day was the most enlightening--he had worked up a tremendous amount of animation over the weekend.  He mentioned that, after spending time in the animation process, he came to appreciate that CSS was truly a language of its own that will allow you do develop using the right calls.  His use of keyframes is an inspiration to would-be page stylers.
