# WJR Code 201 - Day 11

Today I learned...

About attributes.  You can set the attribute SRC of an image file directly (harding coding in the URL/path of the image) or you can leave it blank on the HTML page and use a setAttribute modifier to push an updated SRC reference into a HTML tag.  

We talked a little about inserting video files and audio files, but the big takeaway was that you'd never want to host your own audio or video file input.  I'm still not sure why you wouldn't want to run your media file through YouTube, unless you were dead set on retaining ownership of your file, in which case you are probably a media company and you are dealing with a whole internal team to build and support your media play functionality.  My company's website uses a YouTube player because we just want the video to run across browsers with a minimum of additional configuration.  

We learned about statcounter.com. This appears to be an alternative to google analytics.  I'm not sure why it is superior to Google Analytics, but by the end of the night we will be expected to get a return value from that system and change a display when the counter hits 25.  I have implemented the counter functionality but I have some ways to go to get the return value of the counter.
