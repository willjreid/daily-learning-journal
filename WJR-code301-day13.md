### Day 13 -- Nov 09 ###

Today I continued working with Jeff on our book app blog.  Unfortunately I think Jeff is right at my level, so both of us spend a considerable amount of time staring at our code, trying to indentify where we should wade in to deliver a particular feature.

We were pretty far from the initial day's features on Tuesday--I had managed to start creating everything in a single repo until we walked through the inception docs more closely and broke things out into seperate repos.  Printing out the user stories was very helpful, allowing us to check things off as we go.
