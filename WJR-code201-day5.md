# WJR Code 201 - Day 5

Today I learned...

More about the clone/fork/branch/merge process.  I think I nearly got it, but it will take some practice.  

Today's lab assignment was a good look at automated test coverage.  I look forward to writing my own tests then writing the code to meet them.  In my last software project we had some issues with automated testing--if they are not clearly and fully written to match the business requirements, they will still pass even if the features developed do not.  I observed someone who had tried to solve his array problems with the exact text that the automated tests checked for because it made the tests pass.  After some discussion, the addition of variable references in that array segment helped him realize that his test was now failing, which ultimately meant that the math function was failing. We got the math function to work properly, but if I had written the test I might have tried to implement multiple tests to account for each of the expected return values in the final array.  I might also have tried running multiple sets of variables through the functions automatically to verify that the system returned property values in multiple cases.

This is all very easy to say on this side of learning how to write automated tests.  I'm eager to get into that phase so I can make sure our devs write automated tests that reflect the business value we are trying to achieve.

Also: moving forward I'll be trying to work on the branch/pull/merge process for each journal entry to get more reps.
