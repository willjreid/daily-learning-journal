# WJR Code 201 - Day 12

Today I learned...

about charts.  Linking to the cdnjs library in the head of your HTML file allows you add a <canvas> element which you can turn into a chart.  I guess the chart documentation was an example of the free market determining the quality of product--for major charts like bar charts and pie/donut charts the documentation was pretty extensive and featured examples.  By the time they got to bubble charts and scatter plots they were not investing as much energy in offering full documentation.

I also learned that the click counter solution I devised after Monday's lecture was way overkill.  If we don't add Google Analytics tracking to our project website next week, I need to implement it for my BusMall project on my own so I can walk through the steps and understand the functionality of the updated tags my company implemented 2 years ago.  

The finer execution of some of the JS elements still takes me some significant effort and assistance, but in 2.5 weeks I've gotten a huge boost in my understanding of how complex vs easy some elements of web development should be.  And damn if I don't see Bootstrap everywhere.
