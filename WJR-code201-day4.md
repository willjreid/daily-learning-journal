# WJR Code 201 - Day 4

Today I learned...

To feel a bit more comfortable with branching, though I think I'll need a few more reps to really get the hang of it.  I think the pair programming exercise will help unlock my capabilities for the the process.  I also need to investigate how to correct spelling errors in MD files.

On Images:
Be sure to set the image size within your CSS rather than on the html file.  Be sure to add a Title for mouse-over functionality, and an Alt tag for screen reader functionality

Use var.join(', ') when trying to convert an array into a readable string of content, separated by a comma and space.

Update: ultimately I learned not to feel too comfortable with branching just yet.  It turns out that I had created a repo within a repo, which was just the sort of thing they had warned us.  This may help to explain some slow performance out of my Atom text editor.  A TA helped me delete the extraneous branch I had created, but has encouraged me to work on branching, committing, pull request-ing and merging with each day's journal entries.  I will endeavor to follow that advice.
