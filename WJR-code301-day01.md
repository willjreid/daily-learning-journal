### Day 3 -- Oct 22 ###

************************************************
Today I learned about jumping into the fire.  After a review of tolerance and inclusion, we talked generally about the 301 course then dove into some lab work.  The refactoring to replace var with let and then const worked ok, but without any discussion in class I wasn't sure about the value of using these instead of var.  This evening I watched the Fun, Fun, Function video on var/let/const, and it was 1000% more valuable than the not-very-prescriptive 2012 text on SMACSS that we read before class started.  I think CF needs to sub out the SMACSS reading or make it much more optional, since a 15 minute (passionate) discussion about the reason for categorizing your CSS logic by level of specificity (global / section-related / sub-section && class && id / action && response).  We'll be working on media queries on Tuesday morning to keep things lively.
