##*All the thoughts that are fit to commit*##
### Day 7 -- Oct 31 ###

Today I was pleased by my ability to build a dynamic page for the UI challenge. I'm still not sure I executed the form-builder lab correctly, and I'm looking forward to reviewing the Tuesday starter-code at length to make sure I am solid on the concepts.

Update: it was helpful to pair with Dre in talking through the articleView vs Article.new array.  We worked through the TODOs, referencing his past localStorage work.  Robert Reed was a great resource in talking through the solution.
