# WJR Code 201 - Day 14

Today I learned...

about animations.  Our labwork today didn't call on animations, but perhaps Nick has a trick up his sleeve for Friday afternoon.

In the short term, our lab called for paired work to build a whole new set of features around the contructors for the 20 selable items from BusMall.  Mark was a great partner, and I felt very able to contribute to problem-solving and suggesting structures for handling arrays and persistance.  I felt we colaborated really well in delivering an almost-working solution, and with another hour we would nail it completely.
