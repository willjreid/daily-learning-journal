### Day 18 -- Nov 15 ###

Today we achieved MVP and worked on stretch goals.  I worked with Joel most of the day in coloring icons then getting them to appear dynamically based on the weather forecast.  I tried several different ways to set the listener element dynamically but ended up creating a switch for each month since there are 12 different fields that the system should be listening for.

I probably had some code blindness by 6:00, but after having dinner and taking a fresh start I was able to get the feature to work.  Joy then cleaned it up with a reference to Object.values(airport)[9].
