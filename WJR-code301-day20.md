### Day 20 -- Nov 17th ###

We had a great presentation.  Joy and I tested the user profile capabilities right up to 12:00 on Friday and made sure we could demo all the bells and whistles.  We hit our API limit Thursday night, so we had no margin for error in terms of making more than one new call within 60 seconds, so we had to curate the demo instead of just opening it up to an audience member's preferences.  
I'm really proud of how quickly we hit MVP. If we had two more days, I think we'd aim to add more filtering by activities and flight planning, but it's not a stretch to think that this solution could be valuable to Expedia, or could be valuable to us if we had enough AdSense revenue to cover the $600 premium API plan.  Then we could open things up to 50 or 100 airports per continent and really have something.
