### Day 4 -- Oct 26 ###

Today I was reminded about the importance of attention to detail.  While I felt a little overwhelmed by my Tuesday partner's confidence in knowing the solution path, today's lab has been much more collaborative as Matt and I powered through each feature section to improve our understanding and resolve the feature gaps. I don't feel at all intimidated by paring with him, and I feel we are making good progress toward a solution, albeit slower progress than some of our more advanced classmates.

I have spent a lot of time pouring over the reading at night, but I have come to terms with the fact that might uptake of new data after 9pm is pretty limited, so I am turning over a new leaf of going to bed early and rising (well) before dawn for a run and some morning reading and administration.  We'll see how it goes...
