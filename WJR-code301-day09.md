### Day 9 -- Nov 02 ###

Today I was a bit rushed in working through the comment-heavy lab that went through the server.js file and asked us to indicate which functions on the articles.js file were related/listened for.  I had a hard time understanding the docs, both for the TODOs on the server file, and for the method matching. Also I still can't get postgresql to run.  I'm still not sure where its running or why I'd want to run it in my terminal except for an opportunity to play around with it--it looks like the risk of a data-entry error is greater in the terminal.
Why is there not actually a terminal for me to use in controlling sql? I guess I'm still uncertain where the model is running that we need the 5432 port to reach it.
