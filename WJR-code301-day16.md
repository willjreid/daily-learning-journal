### Day 16 -- Nov 13 ###

Today our team kicked off work on the weather travel app.  The name worked through some tidy iterations, from "Know Whether the Weather is Right for You!" to "Know Whether The Weather..." to "Kno Weather" and finally to "knoWeathr" because we are too hip for extra vowels.  Our color scheme is also hip.  

I was able to frame up the html file and add controllers for the Views.  I paired with Joy and helped break through some of the issues around field requirements and mobile functionality for the range inputs.
