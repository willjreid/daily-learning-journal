# WJR Code 201 - Day 6

Today I learned...

To finally feel comfortable with the branching process.  I was able to articulately explain the repo/clone/branch process to a classmate to help her get started on today's lab.  I missed a step (or two) in Friday's lab about successfully branching and merging for each question, but I think I've got the flow now.

On the object oriented programming side, I'm beginning to see the power of establishing objects. I 'm likely going to find an inelegant solution to tonight's homework, but tomorrow's code review is going to be a barn burner.  I was feeling pretty proud of running a few commands to push updates back into the DOM below the lone function I used to create and log hourly cookie projections for one office, but that will lead to me creating 75 distinct IDs to push all the data across to the sales page.  I was greatly humbled to see someone's solution with four nested functions that created and populated unordered list elements.  I know who I'm nominating for tomorrow's code review...
