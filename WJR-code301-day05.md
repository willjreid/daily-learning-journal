### Day 5 -- Oct 27 ###

Today I was greatly humbled by Matt L's quite, workmanlike approach to knocking out all the lab aspects, including the stretch goals.  I think we had the base assignment done within forty-five minutes, and we spent the next 90 working through stretch goals and documentation.  He has an incredibly good understanding of the fundamentals of what we are trying to accomplish, and of terminal functionality.

From the slack conversation, it sounds like most of the rest of the class got together at some halloween party downtown--perhaps they are younger than my 201 cohort, most of whom seemed to have enough family obligations that a night out during the course seemed unfeasible.  I'm curious how our class will approach Tuesday.

My week swing wildly from partnering with someone who didn't seem to value my contributions very highly, to someone that I was able to lead pretty effectively, back to someone who was utterly polite and had little need of my presence to solve the problem but was not phased by my presence.
