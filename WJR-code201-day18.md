# WJR Code 201 - Day 18

Today I learned...

a little more about transformations. I'm frustrated that you can only have one running at a time through CSS--I tried to have a shape grow (scale) and spin (via a separate rule called on its class) but only the later thing would work...but after a burst of inspiration I see that adding both adjustments within the same transform: will get them both to run--of course if you have the same command twice within the same declaration in CSS it will bet confused and only fire on one of them!!

So that clears things up.  Other than that I learned from Ozge's husband that an ill-informed boss that looks over developer's shoulders is a dangerous boss to work for--I will bear that in mind.

Finally I learned about stretch goals.  We kept our functionality pretty limited, and we had it wrapped up by Wednesday afternoon.  If we expand our scope to various types of procrastination distraction-types we can make things a bit more complex.  We just have a hearty way to work through the page for 90 seconds as-is.
